# Divvy Mobile Technical Exercise

The assignment was pretty simple. I was able to complete the tasks in about 3-4 hours. I had some environment issues that plagued me for much longer though. 

I ended up giving up on the environment issues as I don't believe solving an environment setup issue should prevent me from turning in this assignment on time. As a result, I was not able to create a native iOS module and so I could not integrate the Charts library. I used React Native Chart Kit to display revenue data.
